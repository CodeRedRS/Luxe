                        Concrete curbing is custom designed, continuous, moulded concrete that comes in a wide variety
                        of different shapes, colours and textures. It is an extremely high quality product that is
                        durable enough to be installed in any outdoor setting. Our product is designed to follow the
                        contour of any yard and is perfectly suited for both new construction and mature yards and
                        serves as an attractive, permanent, no-maintenance alternative to conventional landscape edging
                        that will never rust or rot in the elements.

                    <h1 class="text-center h1">The Process</h1>

                    <p>
                        We begin by consulting with you to determine the desired line, shape, form and texture of the
                        curbing. Before any work is started we use water soluble paint to mark the line to be curbed,
                        ensuring you receive the design you want.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, if necessary, we will cut a section of sod (roughly 10 inches wide and 1.5 inches deep) to
                        ensure a flat surface to install the curbing on.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As this is being done, we will mix the concrete, dying it to whichever colour you would like and
                        adding fiber meshing which provides added strength to the final product.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the concrete is fully mixed, we are ready to begin curbing. Concrete is fed into the
                        extruder machine which moulds the mixture into whichever shape you would like. The plywood forms
                        typically associated with concrete work are not required.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The curbing is then trowelled to ensure smooth edges and prepare it for whichever texture or
                        stamp you would like.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once the texture and/or stamp have been completed, we install control joints every 3 feet.
                        Control joints involve essentially cutting half way through the curb. The purpose of this is to
                        control any cracking of the curb as the ground shifts underneath it. If the curb cracks, it
                        should crack in the control joint and not be noticeable.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once everything is finished, we will spray the curbing with a sealer to keep the concrete
                        looking its best for an extended period of time.
                    </p>

                            No. Our installations have minimal impact on your yard. Our equipment does not damage grass
                            in any way.

                            The majority of jobs are completed in a morning or afternoon. Large jobs can take a full day
                            but for the most part, we will have the job completed within a number of hours.

                        <dd>
                            Concrete curbing and walkways – just like any other concrete product – can and will crack
                            over time. We experience very little cracking in our products. We try to avoid this as much
                            as possible by mixing fiber mesh into our concrete to add structural strength to the
                            concrete itself. Still, in our climate that freezes and thaws yearly, tree roots may lift,
                            the ground may shift, etc., which can lead to cracking. In an effort to avoid this, we cut
                            in control joints every 2 to 3 feet. This is designed to give the curb a controlled cracking
                            point and not be noticeable.

                        <dd>
                            Your curb/walkway will be sealed with a cure and sealing agent. This will help protect it
                            from the elements and ensure your colour remains intact.
                        </dd>

                        <dd>
                            As with any concrete product, it is recommended to re-apply a sealant every year or two to
                            keep your curb looking its best. There are a wide variety of different finishes, from matte
                            to a high gloss, are easily applied with either a sprayer or a paint roller, and you can
                            find them at most hardware stores. We also offer re-sealing as a service – please contact us
                            for pricing.
